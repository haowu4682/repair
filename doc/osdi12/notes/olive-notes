1. What is Olive?
Olive is a distributed branching storage system. The main purpose is to provide
an efficient branch service: a branch can be created without copying large
amount of data. The basic idea is data sharing among different versions of
storage branches.

2. What's the difference?
(1) Olive only provides branch storage, which it does not provide anyway to
merge the branches together.
(2) Olive is a storage system, rather than an OS. Some operations cannot be
executed only with a storage system(e.g talking with a hardware clock).
(3) Olive is a distributed system, not a local system.

(1) is the most important. Olive is not designed for two users to work on the
same repository, it is designed for a user to do something temporarily without
harm of the main repository. As a result, merging is not very necessary, and is
too difficult to be implemented on a distributed system in my opinion.
