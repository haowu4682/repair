1. How to define and implement a conflict?
See ``conflict.txt'' for more information.

2. How to decide the way when a user's input has occured in the original branch?
We should feed the process with the original input. However if the input is from a file we might
want to feed it with the current file. The policy should be:
(1) If the current file exists, use the current file
(2) If the current file does not exist, or the file is a device(e.g. keyboard, network, etc.)
    we shall use the stored original input.

3. How to deal with pipes and redirections?
See ``forkexec.txt'' and ``subroutines.txt''

4. FD mapping
See ``fd_manager.txt''

5. Real-time user input
When we open a vim, wait for 30sec and hit some keys to type in values, probably we do not
need to hold for 30sec in replaying.
However, when we run a program, and hit Ctrl+C, or any keys that is used to influence the
control, probably we don't want to change the timing of it.

6. Affecting the record while recording
If we read the record while recording, the recording process will crash. We don't know where
the problem comes from.
