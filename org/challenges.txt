1. How to define and implement a conflict?
See ``conflict.txt'' for more information.

2. How to decide the way when a user's input has occured in the original branch?
We should feed the process with the original input. However if the input is from a file we might
want to feed it with the current file. The policy should be:
(1) If the current file exists, use the current file
(2) If the current file does not exist, or the file is a device(e.g. keyboard, network, etc.)
    we shall use the stored original input.

3. How to deal with pipes and redirections?
