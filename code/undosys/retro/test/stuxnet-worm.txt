Stuxnet Worm

- one of the latet, most powerful: described as "super weapon", "Pandora's Box"
- industrial impact: SIMATIC WinCC SCADA system of Siemens
  => great target & motivation (current virus scanner & IDS are not doing well)
  
- 13 variations, and 600+ samples with different hash values
  => if one of clusters detect one of variations, we can resolve all of entangled variants

- local behavior
  1) hook ntdll
  2) hide files
  => retro can deal with all
  
- spread method
  1) Shortcut file parsing Vulnerability
    => this one is particularly interesting! as Meelap said it spread through flash disk!
  2) RPC remote execution Vulnerability
  3) Print Spooler Service Vulnerability
  => distributed one should connect these method to resolve the intermingled behaviors
