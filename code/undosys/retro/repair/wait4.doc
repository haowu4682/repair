# wait4() strategy
#
# why special?  - this repair routine() should serialize all the execution of
# child/parent process whatever - but the history graph was created with
# multiple processes - then blocking in the wait4() (surely parent process) is
# acceptible but we can't do that (see rerun.wait4()) - we want to propagate
# our repair as far as possible without blocking
#
# how emulate?  - return from (first) wait4() by modifying the argument of
# wait4 to non blocking - since tic of rest syscalls of child process should
# precede this wait()'s tac, the next (second) wait4() should retrieve child
# exit status
#
# wrong implementation?  - tic/tac of wait4() unfortunately overlap in many
# cases - so I intentionally change tac -> tic to avoid this situation
