Filesystem
==========

The `retro' module exports information using the debugfs filesystem.
You can find the following files inside the `retro' directory, usually
under /sys/kernel/debug.

  enabled:

	This is used to turn on/off tracing. By default `retro' traces
	the whole system.

  process:

	This is used to support per-process tracing. If set, `retro'
	only traces processes with ptrace enabled.

  ctl:

	This is used to specify the pid of the controller (retroctl),
	the syscalls of which `retro' will ignore.

  syscallN:

	Syscall data, using relayfs.

  kprobesN:

	Kprobes data (e.g., inode deletion), using relayfs.
