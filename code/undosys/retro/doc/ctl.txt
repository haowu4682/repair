retroctl
========

This program is used to control the `retro' module from user space. Try
`retroctl --help' for usage.

Basically retroctl starts N threads, one for each CPU, to pump data
generated by the `retro' module. Currently it reads two files, syscallN
and kprobesN, in debugfs, and copy the data into the specified location.

TODO: compression and garbage collection.

To do per-process tracing, retroctl creates a process with ptrace
enabled, using the given command. In this case the `retro' module only
records that process and its descendants, assuming that no other
processes in the system are being traced or debugged. For example,
	retroctl -p -o /tmp -- ls -l
will trace `ls' only, with data stored in /tmp.
