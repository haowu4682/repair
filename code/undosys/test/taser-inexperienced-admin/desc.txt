Inexperienced administrator

Scenario: 

//
// 1. create user
//    adduser
//
// 2. create album
//    gallery create album
//
// 3. create add two pictures (by attacker)
//    gallery add pictures (=> thumbnail)
//
// 4. create add two pictures (by normal user)
//    gallery create newalbum1
//    gallery create newalbum2
//

1. The administrator uses the photo Gallery software (which is also
used as background load in the experiments) to store his digital
pictures and also creates an account for a guest user. (./setup.sh)

2. The new account is set up with a weak password because the admin-
istrator expects the guest to change the password soon. (./setup.sh)

3. Then, the administrator adds new albums and pictures under his account and
logs off. 

4. Before the guest can change his password, an attacker at
a remote site logs into the guest’s account by using a dictionary at-
tack. The attacker creates two new albums and uploads 14 pictures
to the site and then views the administrator’s albums. 

5. Later, the administrator views the albums and discovers
inappropriate images in the two new albums. 

6. He contacts the guest user and finds out that the guest user did
not create these albums.  

Correct recovery actions: 

Remove the attacker’s album and all related data (such as thumbnails)
generated by Gallery. 

Detection point: A directory containing an attacker’s album.
