Illegal Storage

Scenario:

 1. A user logs into the system and launches the pwck local
 escalation exploit. (just login as root)

 2. creates a new root account root100 by directly
 writing to the /etc/passwd and the /etc/shadow files.

 3. creates a directory under another user’s directory (as root) and
 downloads 500 illegal pictures

 4. downloads a binary ls program from the userlevel Ambient’s Rootkit
 (ARK) in the user’s bin directory to hide the existence of the
 illegal directory. 

 5. the victim user logs in, uses the trojaned ls program and creates
 two files in his home directory. (=> rootkit ls -> root100/log1, root100/log2)

 6. The attacker logs back in as root100 after two days and downloads
 two more pictures into the hidden directory.  (=> login as root100,
 download two more)

Correct recovery actions:

 - Remove all the 1) illegal pictures and the 2) hidden directory,
 the 3) trojaned ls binary, and the 4) home directory of the attacker’s
 root100 account.

 - the legitimate versions of the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files
 need to be recovered.

Detection point: 

 The trojaned ls program is detected by the victim and given to the
 trace phase (=> attacker's first/second login)
