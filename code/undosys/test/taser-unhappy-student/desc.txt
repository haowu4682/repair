Unhappy Student

Scenario:

1. exploit wu-ftp (=> login as root)
2. change the permission of grades file in prof's home directory (o+w) (chmod +o P/grades)
3. A modifies the grade file (=> A logins, echo A=A+ >> P/grades)
4. A copies the prof's home dir to own dir (=> cp P/grades ~/grades)
5. B login & copy modified grades file to his home directory (=> B logins, cp P/grades ~/grades)
6. create two other files (=> touch B1, B2)

Correct recovery actions: 

1. Recover the original grades file in the professor’s directory
2. restore the attributes of this file
3. remove all copied files in both student A’s and student B’s home directories

Detection point: 

1. The grades file that the professor finds is writable by others.
  (A, B, root(attacker) are considered to be attackers)
