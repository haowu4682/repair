Syscall
=======

This document describes how syscall logs are generated and processed.

Log
===

The `retro' records each syscall at its enter and exit. For performance
reasons, `retro' does _not_ buffer any data but directly streams data
into relayfs. Therefore, there are two records corresponding to each
syscall in the raw log.

Merge
=====

To simplify processing, the repair script merges the two records into
one record object, where `tic' and `tac' refer to the timestamps of
enter and exit, respectively.
