Incremental loading plan
========================

Action objects are always fully-loaded (meaning, if an Action object exists,
its inputs and outputs sets should be fully populated, and the actor reference
should be correct).

Nodes (either data or actor nodes) can be less than fully-populated.  This
means that, it's OK for a node to exist without having a complete set of
checkpoints, a complete set of actions (for an actor), and a complete set
of readers and writers (for a data node).

For nodes, the framework will call the loader corresponding to the node's
name (see mgrapi.LoaderMap.register_loader), with the node's name as the
argument, before using the node's checkpoint list, action list, or reader
and writer sets.

The expected plan for the loader is to load up all of the actions that
touch the node in question (which, by rule 1 above, must be fully loaded
at that time), and call register on those actions, which adds them to
the node's action/reader/writer sets as appropriate.
