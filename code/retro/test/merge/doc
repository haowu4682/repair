fsmgr searches as follows.

suppose trunk is mounted at
/mnt/retro/trunk/
then the snap must be mounted at
/mnt/retro/snap-%date-spec%/

So, for the first run, we mount trunk-snap-1 at /mnt/retro/trunk. For the
second run, we mount trunk-snap-2 at the same place.

For the repair run, we can start with trunk-snap-2 still mounted. As the first
execution starts to get replayed, everything will get rolled back to whatever
is in snap-%date-spec%.
