--- paper.php experiment ---

On request in hotcrp-resin makes:
 - 151 calls to echo
 - 13 DB queries (2 of which are for the policy).
   - DB queries: one gets 20 fields at once, the rest get 5 or fewer.
 - Output 8.5K of HTML
 - Roughly 92ms with -g -O0

Using php -N instead of Apache:
 - Latencies of about 92ms running with php -N (with -g -O0) match Web
   client visible latencies.  Also, when running throughput with 30
   clients via Apache, throughput is about 1/.092 (11req/sec,
   22req/sec with two cores).
